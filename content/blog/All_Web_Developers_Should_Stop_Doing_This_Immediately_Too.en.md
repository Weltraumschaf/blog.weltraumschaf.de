[Christopher Mims complains  about the fact that a website  is treating him with
his  iPad  as  a  second  class citizen][1].  He’s  right  that  web  developers
shouldn’t do that. But  he’s arguing that he don’t want  to download the offered
iPad-App because in his option this is  antisocial doing that on a low bandwidth
public wifi. Is it better to watch a video over that low bandwidth public wifi?

And more important: I  wanted to give him this feedback on his  blog. But I have
to  register  to  do  that.  Hey   Chris,  don’t  bother  me  with  this  stupid
registration stuff. I don’t wanna  register on technologyreview.com to leave one
comment. You’re patronizing me in the same way ;)
